## Vowels ✅
### Simple vowels
 - ㅏ = á
 - ㅑ = já
 - ㅓ= a
 - ㅕ = ja
 - ㅗ = o
 - ㅛ = jo
 - ㅜ = u
 - ㅠ = ju
 - ㅡ = ü
 - ㅣ= i 
### Complex vowels
 - ㅐ = e
 - ㅒ = je
 - ㅔ = é
 - ㅖ = é/jé
 - ㅘ = vá
 - ㅙ = ve
 - ㅚ = vé
 - ㅝ - va
 - ㅞ - ve
 - ㅟ - vi
 - ㅢ - üi/i
#### Exceptions
 - In case of verb conjugation 져, 쪄 and 쳐 turn into 저, 쩌 and 처. In
   Hungarian it would be csj to cs. Due to an already existing grammar
   rule in Hungarian which says that csj turns into ccs, the program
   will transliterate it as csj since it would be too complicated to
   check what part of speech a word belongs to.
 - ㅖis pronounced as 'é' except in 예 and 례
 - ㅢ is pronounced as 'i' if the syllable starts with a consonant
# Disregarded rules
- Exception:  밟 is pronounced as 밥 when it precedes a consonant, and 넓 is pronounced as 넙 in instances like the following.
